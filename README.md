- Web Storage API (localStorage) — client-side persistence
- CSS — custom styling
- Node.js and npm — scripts and tooling
- Git, GitHub Pages, gh-pages — deployment

  - So that I can manage my assignments more efficiently.

- TODO User Story 2:

  - I want to edit my existing TODO items,
  - So that I can keep an up-to-date list of assignments.

- TODO User Story 3:

  - As someone who's completed a task on their list,
  - I want to mark a TODO item as complete,
  - So that I can keep track of my progress.

- Contacts User Story 1

  - As someone who needs to add a new contact,
  - I want to add new contact information,
  - So I can contact the individual.

- Contacts User Story 2

  - As someone who needs to update one of their contact's email address,

## Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Include the ability to reorder TODOs
2. Add the option to include a due date for TODOs
3. Link TODOs with contacts for collaborative task tracking.
